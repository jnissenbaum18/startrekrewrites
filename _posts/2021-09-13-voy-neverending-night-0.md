The premise of this story is to combine the thematic and dramatic elements of the Star Trek: Voyager episodes Night (s05e01) and The Void (s07e15) respectively. This story takes place at the beginning of season five as if it were the season opener and replaced Night. 

Prior knowledge of either of the aforementioned episodes is not necessary to read this story; nor is it necessary to have watched the first four seasons of Voyager. The only episode that the reader should watch before reading this story is the series opening episode The Caretaker (s01e01 & s01e02). As the events of The Caretaker are heavily referenced within. It is also recommended that the fourth season finale episode Hope and Fear (s04e26) be watched as well for additional context.

While it is not necessary to view the first four seasons of Voyager, key events that took place during those seasons are referenced within the story. As such, the reader should be aware that there will be spoilers of certain plot developments that occurred in the first four seasons of Voyager. 

However, it is the author's hope that reading this story will only enhance a new viewer's experience, rather than diminish it. As such, if you are spoiler-averse, please do not let the knowledge that there are spoilers ahead prevent you from reading this story. 

Thank you and please enjoy.
