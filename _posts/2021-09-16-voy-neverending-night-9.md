*Captains Log, Stardate 52098.2: The Alliance ships have set course for the space station at the center of the theta radiation. Many of the captains disagreed at first since it would mean a further drain on our shields. But the prospect of finding a way to escape the Void proved to be enough to sway them.* 

Seven of Nine toiled away at the sickbay console. She had originally wanted to spend her time in the past two days conducting an analysis on the station in the astrometrics lab as Voyager approached it. However, since Captain Janeway had offered to provide sanctuary for the other members of Fantome’s race, the Doctor had requested her assistance in improving the musical communications program.

Seven watched as Fantome plus three other members of his race sat on the biobed on the far side of the still darkened sickbay. They all tapped rapidly on their individual PADD’s, producing a cacophony of sounds. Each PADD played in a different octave to differentiate each user from one another. The sounds they generated had a unique dynamic quality to it. At first, it seemed to be just random noise. But as one continued to listen, it was clear that there was very much order in the chaos. 

Suddenly Fantome saw something out of the corner of his eye. Like a herd of cats that had just been startled, all the noise from the PADD’s ceased as they all turned to view the disturbance. From behind Seven, she heard someone begin to clap in an enthusiastic ovation. Seven turned to see Captain Janeway, totally enthralled by the sights and sounds coming from Fantome and his cohort. 

“Marvelous piece.” Janeway raved in awe. “Did they compose it or did you?” She asked

“They did.” The Doctor replied. “Though strictly speaking, it’s not a composition. It’s more of a conversation.”

“I’m impressed.” Janeway said, approaching Seven and the Doctor.

“I wish I could take credit.” The Doctor began. “But Seven here was the one who originally came up with the idea as well as being the chief architect of the program which allows them to communicate.” He said beaming at Seven. “On top of that, it was Fantome who taught the others in a fraction of the time it took him to learn. They are a highly intelligent species.”

“The language is already developing its own unique grammar and syntax, independent of our input.” Seven added.

“That suggests that they have a language of their own.” Janeway concluded.

The Doctor nodded. “Mhmm. It could be telepathic. But they seem just as comfortable communicating through music now.”

“I hypothesize that telepathy requires greater effort for them.” Seven said. “Thus making music a more efficient form of communication.”

Janeway turned around to Seven having just now taken in what the Doctor had said a moment ago. “You created this for them?”

“That’s correct.” Seven replied.

“And what have they given you in return?” Janeway gently probed, trying to tease out an answer to Seven’s apparently inconsistent position.

Seven raised her eyebrow and took in a breath, stalling for time as she concocted an answer. “Nothing...But I felt that it was worth the effort.”

Janeway just gave her a warm smile before turning back to watch the aliens talk to each other. “Could their species be native to the Void?” She asked.

“It’s certainly possible.” The Doctor said. “But their numbers are dwindling.”

Janeway looked at him in confusion. “Dwindling? Why?”

“I scanned each of them when they were brought on board.” The Doctor said. “Each one of them was suffering from severe theta radiation poisoning. They said they’ve lived for a long time in the Void, but now they’re dying Captain. The more the radiation continues to build, the fewer of them there are.”

As Janeway watched Fantome and his friends talk to one another, her feelings turned from curiosity and awe to fury and rage. After all she had been through, all she had seen, she thought she could never be surprised anymore. But out here, in the middle of the most remote part of space, she watched one of the most breathtaking and awe inspiring sights she had ever seen. The sheer improbability of happenstance that had to occur for this very moment to take place was beyond reason. How anyone would want to destroy something as extraordinary as this was incomprehensible to her. The thought abhorred Janeway down to her very core.

“Tell them…” Janeway started, her voice filled with determination. “...Tell them that I’m going to find the cause of what’s killing them. Tell them that I’m going to find it and I’m going to eliminate it. No matter the cost.”

“Aye, Captain.” The Doctor said, understanding her feelings.

“Bridge to Captain Janeway.” Chakotay’s voice said over the comm system.

“Go ahead.” Janeway said. 

“We’re approaching the alien station.” Chakotay said.

“On my way.” Janeway replied.

She allowed herself one final moment to observe Fantome before turning to Seven. “Seven, I need you in astrometrics.”

“Aye Captain.” Seven replied.

The two exited sickbay, Seven returned to astrometrics while Janeway went to the bridge. Once there, Janeway settled into her seat. 

“We’re coming into range now.” Ensign Kim reported.

“On screen.” Janeway commanded.

The viewscreen flashed on and Janeway got her first good look at the alien station. It was a spindly looking structure. It’s main body was roughly cylindrical, housing most of the vital components of the station. Arms extended out in all directions from the superstructure. Each arm was segmented at one hundred and twenty degree angles from the previous segment, making it look like a giant honeycomb. The station was tinged dark brown and it looked absolutely ancient.

“Harry?” Janeway said, asking Ensign Kim for a report.

“The station is at least several centuries old.” Kim said. “The arms contain both docking equipment and sensor suites. It looks like the central structure houses the main power plant, life support systems, control rooms and…” He paused to analyze what the computers were telling him “...one very large mechanical complex, which seems to be drawing most of the station's power.”

“Is it safe to dock?” Chakotay asked.

“The structural integrity of the arms appears stable. Atmospheric composition reads as .3 bar oxygen, .2 bar nitrogen and .4 bar argon, breathable for humans. However, the interior of the station is flooded with theta radiation. We’ll have to go in with environmental suits until we can clear the radiation.” Kim said.

“Very well. Signal the fleet to hold position while we investigate the station.” Janeway said 
before turning to Chakotay. “Commander, assemble an away team.”

“Aye, Captain. Harry, Tuvok.” Chakotay said, summoning the two officers to come with him down to the airlock.

Before Ensign Kim could comply, his console bleeped with an incoming message alert. “Captain, the Malons are insisting that they be allowed to board the station. They’re saying that their environmental gear is better suited to handle the high levels of theta radiation.”

Chakotay turned to Janeway. “Looks like they don’t trust us.”

“Or there’s something on that station they don’t want us to find.” Janeway mused.

“Do we turn them down?” Chakotay asked.

“Without a good reason, I can’t just send them away.” Janeway looked at Kim. “Harry, tell them that they can only bring two crewmen aboard as a safety precaution, and that they will be under Chakotay’s command.”

“Aye Captain.” Kim responded.

Janeway looked at Chakotay. “Keep an eye on them while you’re over there.”

“Will do.” Chakotay said before exiting the bridge with Tuvok and Kim.

Voyager lined up alongside one of the arms closest to the main structure and docked with the station. The away team consisted of Commander Chakotay, Lieutenant Commander Tuvok, Lieutenant Torres, Ensign Kim and Seven of Nine. Torres brought along some of her engineering staff while Tuvok had assembled a security detail. Chakotay split the group in two. Chakotay, Torres, and Kim were going to try and access the central computer systems, while Tuvok and Seven were going to attempt to figure out what the unidentified complex was. Chakotay signaled the two Malon to meet them in the central control room. 

The two teams went to work. As Chakotay ventured through the halls of the station, he swept his SIM’s beacon across its various surfaces. The metals that lined the walls and conduits had become rusted and fatigued with age. Turning what may have been a shiny new silver into a tarnished old dark olive. With each step, Chakotay could hear the creaking and groaning of the deck plating echo throughout the hallway, as if a great beast had awoken from a deep slumber.

Tuvok and Seven split off from the group along with some of the engineering team. Chakotay’s group navigated their way into the control room. It was large and spacious, reminding Chakotay of an opera house or a museum. Computer interfaces lined the walls. Above him was a massive support structure inset with large display screens. In the center of the room was a ring shaped console divided into several individual stations. Additionally, he noted that there were no chairs of any kind in sight.

B’Elanna Torres stepped forward to the central ring console and placed her tool kit on top of it. “If I can access the main computer, I may be able to bring these control interfaces back online.”

“Just don’t blow us out into space.” Chakotay jested.

“I’ll try my best.” Torres replied. “Harry, see if you can locate the primary power cables and data lines that feed into this room.”

“On it.” Kim said, scanning the room with his tricorder.

“Commander?” Said one of the men from Tuvok’s security detail.

Chakotay turned around to see that two Malon were being held just outside the room by the guard. “Let them through.” Chakotay said.

One of the men was Controller Emck. He spied what Torres and Kim were doing as he approached. “Commander Chakotay.” He said through his isolation suit helmet.

“Controller Emck.” Chakotay responded. “Our people are working on getting main power back online. Just sit tight for now.”

“Very well.” Emck replied, casually walking over to observe what Torres was doing.

While keeping one eye on the two Malon, Chakotay tapped the communicator button on his chestplate. “Chakotay to Tuvok.”

“Go ahead, Commander.” Tuvok’s voice replied through the suit speakers.

“We’re at the control room. B’Elanna is working on restoring main power. How’s it coming on your end.”

“Seven of Nine has begun her work analyzing the complex. We are holding position here.” Tuvok reported.

“Have you encountered any other lifeforms on the station?” Chakotay asked.

“Not yet.” Tuvok responded.

“Understood, let’s check in with each other every thirty minutes.” Chakotay said.

“Acknowledged.” Tuvok replied, closing the channel.

“Looks like there’s an active power circuit here, B'Elanna.” Kim said, reading off his tricorder. “It’s leading into the central console.”

“Which station?” Torres asked, looking around for an active console screen.

Kim walked over to the side of the ring opposite Torres and she moved to join him. “In here.” He said.

Torres brushed off the top of the console with her glove, kicking up a plume of dust. It was totally dark and did not respond when she tapped her finger to it. She retrieved some tools from her kit and knelt down beside the panel that covered the console’s circuitry. “The computer may just be on standby.” She drew her phaser and set it to narrow beam mode. She aimed the phaser at the edges of the panel and began cutting. “If I can send a signal into the active circuit. The computer may just bring itself back online.”

“Hard to believe that a space station could last as long as this one has.” Kim thought out loud.

“The designers definitely knew what they were doing.” Torres observed.

Torres finished cutting through the edges of the panel and removed it. She and Kim scanned the various wires and circuit boards that were inside, attempting to ascertain which was the correct one to activate. After a few minutes, Torres had identified what she thought was the right one. 

“I think this should do it.” Torres said, attaching the leads from a modular power cell to it. She then entered in a series of commands into her tricorder.

For a moment, nothing happened. But then, Chakotay heard a deep rumbling sound emanate from the corridors outside the control room. “B’Elanna.” Chakotay said, concerned. 

“Somethings happening.” She replied, watching the readings from her tricorder.

Chakotay looked up and the display panels detached from their idle positions and began to move outward from the support structure. Enlarging the room to an even greater degree. “I can see that.” He said to Torres dryly, hoping she had inputted the correct command sequence. The hinges of the mechanical arms that held up the screens screeched and protested as they rotated. The entire station had become alive with all sorts of harsh metallic noises. The floor began to vibrate underneath Chakotay’s feet. 

Suddenly, all the computer displays in the room flashed on, once again alive with power. The larger screens above Chakotay had finished retreating into the ceiling. They gradually illuminated themselves, now displaying a litany of information in some alien language. In the center of the room, above the ring console an enormous transparent hologram appeared. Chakotay had seen Seven’s attempts at producing a map of the Void in astrometrics, but this was many times more detailed. Chakotay could see the entire shape of the Void from here. It had a profile like an oblate spheroid, as if someone had taken a gigantic rubber ball and sat on it.

Within the projection, Chakotay could see vast amounts of objects. Most of which he assumed were ships or debris. But within the Void, spaced in a circle at regular intervals were larger objects. One in particular had a number of smaller objects surrounding it. Chakotay guessed that these larger objects represented space stations within the Void, and he had found the one they were currently at. Chakotay counted twelve stations in total. Nine of them were colored red, while two others were colored blue. The one Voyager was now docked at was colored green. 

Chakotay, still in awe of what he was observing, absently depressed the communicator button on his environmental suit. “Chakotay to Voyager.”

“Go ahead Commander.” Janeway’s voice responded.

“Captain…” Chakotay said, his voice trailing off.

“Yes?” Janeway asked, concerned. “What is it Commander?”

Finally, Chakotay just said. “You have to see this.”
