## What is startrekrewrites.com?

This website is a personal project of mine. The idea was to take some of the missed
opportunities or not as well executed episodes/movies of Star Trek and rewrite them into full (and hopefully better) stories.

## Which episodes/movies are you going to rewrite?

I have a few ideas right now, the top of which is either a rewrite of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock or an analysis post about Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. But I am open to suggestions. Feel free to shoot me an email if you have a good idea.

## How often will you be posting?

I have no idea. It depends on my schedule, my motivation and the community reaction. The Neverending Night took me a month to complete working on it nearly full time. So I would not expect frequent posting.
